Codebase for Rover H, 2024 from the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier 
========================================================

Introduction
------------

This codebase would contain the latest code for running the rover both manually and autonomously which needs to be run from the Xavier. I hope this code would be updated on a daily basis, with useful commits and adequate documentation so that both members from Team Anveshak and outside can read, understand and provide useful changes. Do note that changes here would be final, and ensure you commit those changes only after adequate testing. Multiple versions of codes are present currently, and stale code still needs to be segregated from code being used actively. 

The code is divided into:
* Traversal ([/src/traversal2/scripts](https://github.com/anveshak2683/RoverH2024/tree/main/src/traversal2/scripts))
* Navigation ([/src/navigation2/scripts](https://github.com/anveshak2683/RoverH2024/tree/main/src/navigation2/scripts)))
* Arm ([/src/arm2/](https://github.com/anveshak2683/RoverH2024/tree/main/src/arm2/)) 
* IK ([/src/inverse_kinematics/](https://github.com/anveshak2683/RoverH2024/tree/main/src/inverse_kinematics/))
